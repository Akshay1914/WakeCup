                        Conducted once every year, our Champion series is a serious coffee aficionado’s dream 
                        come true. Enthusiasts from across the country gather at our Seattle facility for 3 days of 
                        intense brewing to get ready for the Bean King Champion contest held at Montreal every 
                        year. This is not to be missed. And we’ve got the awards to prove it.
